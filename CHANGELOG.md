Release notes
=============

This document describes all the changes made to the *Institutions API*
document, starting from its first beta draft version.


1.0.0-rc3
---------

* Now this API is serving references to other LOS types too (not only
  `Course`s).


1.0.0-rc2
---------

 * The `<response>` element has been renamed to
   `<course-replication-response>`.


1.0.0-rc1
---------

Initial release. (Since this API seemed really simple, we skipped the `0.x.y`
versions altogether.)
